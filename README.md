# Weather API
In order the grab the weather report for each airport, you need to do a set so things. You need to open the airports.csv file which contains the information about every airport that exists. I made a for loop that will cycle through the aiports.csv file. The user has to input an aiport name and if it exists in the .csv file it will find the longitude and latitude of that airport. From there there will be an api request of the current weather report in JSON format based on the location of the given longitude and latitude of the .csv file. There is test file that will run through several different airports. If an invalid airport name is selected, an error message will pop up.
